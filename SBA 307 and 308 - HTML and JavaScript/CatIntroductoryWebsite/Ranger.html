                Ranger hung out on my back porch in San Antonio for about a month before I decided to take him in. He
                was very skinny, and I thought he was around 1 yr old. Turns out he was chipped, and was 3 yrs old. The
                orignal owner gave him away, and was no longer in contact with the following owner. We kept Ranger and
                he has been so happy ever since. His favorite toy is a pom-pom ball.</p>
